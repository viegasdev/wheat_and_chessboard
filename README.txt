Hello developer! I'm glad that you're here!
My name is Rodrigo, I'm from Portugal and this project was made to help with a math project
that I had to do on school about the "Wheat and chessboard problem". It is a mathematical
succession with the general term = 2^(n-1).
In this project, you're supposed to put the "n" that is the number of the chessboard square
and then it outputs the number of wheat grains that the invetor of the chess would receive
in that one.
The project is entirely in portuguese but if you want an english (or any other language version)
just talk to be here or in Twitter (username in my profile) and I'll take care of that for you!
Thank you so much!
       
                         Rodrigo Viegas
